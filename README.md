JSONAPI is a plugin for Bukkit that allows you to access data and other information about your server and your players through a simple, yet secure, HTTP API. This allows you to make **awesome websites**, **iPhone apps**, and a way for your **players to purchase goods online and automatically receive them in game**.

However, this plugin won't do all of that by itself. It is simply an API that allows you to assemble the features in a way that makes sense for your needs.

## Why this Fork?

Because sending messages to an external server (Adminium) without the consent of the plugin user. Is just plain wrong. This version has adminium ripped out. I'll only start using the upstream again if Adminium can be disabled AND is disabled by default!
